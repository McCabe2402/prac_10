Estimates. I believe my overall coding skills have improved massively. From not being able to, to understanding and being able to read most code. 
I did enjoy the learning in the subject. 

Reviews: I will be honest, I did reviews for others but I never pulled one. GitHub still confuses me. 
Hopefully it doesnt ruin my score. I do enjoy working alone too. 

If at all possible, allow for people to choose whether they work in groups or alone.
